# Simple Tabs Project

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of tabbed navigation using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is designed to help beginners understand **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** in JavaScript.

## 📋 Project Description

The webpage contains four tabs: **First Tab**, **Second Tab**, **Third Tab**, and **Fourth Tab**. When a user clicks on a tab:

- The currently displayed content is hidden.
- The selected tab's content is displayed.
- The selected tab is visually highlighted with a bottom border.

By default, the **First Tab** is active when the page loads.
