# 🍪 Cookie Consent

A simple cookie consent popup created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is part of the [roadmap.sh projects](https://roadmap.sh/projects/cookie-consent) collection.

## 📋 Project Description

Many websites display a cookie consent popup to inform users about the use of cookies and to obtain their consent. In this project, a simple popup is shown when the user visits the page. It includes a message and a button to accept the consent. Once accepted, the popup disappears.


## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or download** the project files.

2. **Make sure you have the following files:**
   - `index.html` – The main HTML page
   - `styles.css` – Styling for the page and popup
   - `index.js` – JavaScript logic for showing/hiding the popup
   - `cookie.png` – (Optional) Image used in the popup

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser** to see the popup in action.

   - You can use a live server extension in VS Code for a better development experience.
   - Or just double-click `index.html`.
