- Place and span images using `grid-column`, `grid-row`, and `grid-area`

### 📱 Responsive Design
- Make the layout adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes using `auto-fit`, `minmax()`, and media queries
- Ensure a clean and functional design on both desktop and mobile devices

### 🎯 Alignment & Spacing
- Use properties like `gap`, `justify-items`, and `align-items` to control spacing and positioning
- Apply padding/margin where necessary to keep a consistent layout
